Hi there!

My name is Lesley Wardenaar and I am a Master student Data science and society at Tilburg University. At this time I am writing my thesis about the influence of Twitter and Reddit on predicting the price of Cardano. Cardano is a cryptocurrency and can be seen as one of the top alt-coins that today's market offers. I have made use of RNN, LSTM and GRU  and added features from the Tweets and Reddit comments to see how and if it improves the prediction power of the model.

At this time I am still in progress and I will update this page in the process of my thesis.
