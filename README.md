Hi there!

My name is Lesley Wardenaar and I am a Master student Data science and society at Tilburg University. At this time I am writing my thesis about the influence of Twitter and Reddit on predicting the price of Cardano. Cardano is a cryptocurrency and can be seen as one of the top alt-coins that today's market offers. I have made use of an RNN as a baseline and added features from the Tweets and Reddit comments to see how and if it improves the prediction power of the model.

At this time I am still in progress and I will update this page to in the process of my thesis.
